# Clock-Animation
## Clock - README

### Project Overview
This project is a simple **Analog Clock** web application designed using HTML and CSS. The clock displays the numbers 1 to 12 in a circular layout and includes animated hour, minute, and second hands. It visually represents the current time on the clock face.

### Features
- A **circular clock face** with numbers from 1 to 12.
- **Animated clock hands** for hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Customizable and scalable for use as part of a larger project or as a standalone feature.

### File Structure
The project consists of the following files:

1. **index.html** (Main HTML file)
2. **clock.css** (CSS file for styling and animations)

### How to Use
1. **Displaying the Clock**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
   - The clock will display with numbers from 1 to 12, and the hour, minute, and second hands will be shown.

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - The CSS file (`clock.css`) will control the layout and animation of the clock hands. Make sure this file is linked correctly to ensure the clock appears and works as intended.

### Required Assets
- **clock.css**: A CSS file that is responsible for:
  - Styling the numbers and clock face.
  - Animating the clock hands.
  
### Browser Compatibility
- The clock is designed to work across all modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). Ensure the browser supports CSS animations for the clock hands to work properly.

### Future Enhancements
- Add real-time functionality using JavaScript to reflect the current time.
- Customize the design with different themes, colors, or styles for the clock face and hands.
- Add sound effects like a ticking sound for the second hand.
- Make the clock responsive to different screen sizes.
